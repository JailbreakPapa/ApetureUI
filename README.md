# ApertureUI

ApertureUI is a HTML/CSS/JS UI Toolkit for video-games, real-time graphics applications and more.

Utilizing a light-weight framework, and minimal thirdparty dependancys, it can be used in many applications, where performance must stay a high priority.

The toolkit aims to be a open-source replacement for other Web-based UI Toolkits, like Coherent GameFace.

# Platforms

The current supported platforms that Aperture Can work with is Windows.

Linux WILL be supported before the first toolkit release. 

# Console Platforms (NDA)

Of-course, for the toolkit to reach and be of use to All developers, targeting consoles is a must.

But due to the locked-down nature of console development, ApertureUI for consoles will stay closed-source.

As for now, PC/Mobile platforms will forever stay open-source, but consoles will be given by a case-by-case basis.
